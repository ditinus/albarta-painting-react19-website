        1. KNOW INSPIRATION DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK
        When looking through magazines and Pinterest, keep in mind that what works in one space may not work in yours. Lighting, room size, and existing furnishings all play a role in how a color will look in your space.
  
        2. WHAT KIND OF MOOD DO YOU WANT TO SET?
        Different colors evoke different emotions. Consider how you want to feel in the space before selecting a color.
  
        3. BE BOLD BUT SMART
        If you love bold colors, consider using them as accents rather than painting entire rooms.
  
        4. TEST PROPERLY WITH NO COLOR LIMITATIONS
        Always test paint samples in your space and observe them at different times of day.
  
        5. BE AWARE OF UNDERTONES
        Every color has undertones that can dramatically affect how it looks in your space.
  
        6. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE WALLS
        Consider how the color will work with your floors, ceiling, and trim.
  
        7. TWO COLORS CAN WORK ON YOUR WALLS
        Using two colors can add interest and dimension to your space when done correctly.
